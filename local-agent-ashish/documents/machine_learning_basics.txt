Machine Learning Fundamentals

Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs
- Examples: classification, regression
- Common algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Goal is to discover hidden patterns
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Common algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders

Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties to guide learning
- Examples: game playing, robotics, autonomous systems
- Common algorithms: Q-learning, policy gradients

Key Concepts

Training and Testing
- Training set: data used to train the model
- Validation set: data used to tune hyperparameters
- Test set: data used to evaluate final model performance

Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting: model learns training data too well, poor generalization
- Underfitting: model is too simple to capture underlying patterns
- Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting

Feature Engineering
- Process of selecting and transforming input variables
- Can significantly impact model performance
- Includes normalization, scaling, and creating new features

Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall for classification
- Mean squared error, R-squared for regression
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation

Common Algorithms

Linear Models
- Linear regression for continuous targets
- Logistic regression for binary classification
- Simple to understand and implement

Tree-Based Methods
- Decision trees: interpretable, handle mixed data types
- Random forests: ensemble of trees, reduces overfitting
- Gradient boosting: sequential tree building

Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neural networks
- Can learn complex non-linear patterns
- Deep learning uses multiple hidden layers

Applications
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommender systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial modeling
