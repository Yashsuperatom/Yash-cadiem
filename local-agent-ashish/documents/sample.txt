This is a sample document for testing the RAG AI agent.

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines information retrieval with language generation to provide accurate and contextual answers to queries.

Key features of this system:
1. Document indexing from multiple file formats
2. Vector-based similarity search
3. AI-powered answer generation using Google Gemini
4. RESTful API endpoints for easy integration

This system can handle various document types including:
- Text files (.txt, .md)
- PDFs
- Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Web content (HTML)
- Data files (JSON, CSV, XML)

The system uses ChromaDB for vector storage and persistence, ensuring fast retrieval even with large document collections.
